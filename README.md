Web API sample project

Event sourced CQRS style design. As write requests are received on the API, commands are generated by the controllers and the CommandBus transmits them to ICommandHandler implementations to update the write side by generating events to transform the state. Events are persisted to the EventStoreContext to provide a log. The events are received by the EventBus and transmitted to IEventHandler implementations to update the read model.

All data is persisted in-memory by Entity Framework and survives as long as the application lifecycle.
