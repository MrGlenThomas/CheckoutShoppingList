**REST API sample project**

## Event sourced CQRS style design built in .NET Core ASP.NET WebAPI.

As requests are received on the API to update data, commands are generated by the controllers and the CommandBus transmits them to ICommandHandler implementations to update the write-side data model by generating events to transform the state. Events are persisted to the EventStoreContext to provide a log. The events are received by the EventBus and transmitted to IEventHandler implementations to update the read model.

All data is persisted in-memory by Entity Framework and survives as long as the process lifecycle.

### Features:
* Dependency inversion is handled by Structuremap
* Swagger has been integrated to provide a web front-end for easy testing interaction with the API functionality
* Logging is implemented using .NET Core's in-built logging system. Log entries have event IDs to facilitate accurate system monitoring
* Use of .NET Core's InMemoryCache demonstrated on a controller method
* Authorisation using the ASP.NET identity system
* JWT bearer  tokens
* Data persisted (in-memory) using Entity Framework
